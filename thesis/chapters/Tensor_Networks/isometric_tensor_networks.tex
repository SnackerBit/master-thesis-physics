An isometric tensor network is a tensor network whose tensor diagrams bonds can be consistently assigned with arrows. In particular we will look at finite tensor networks with all arrows pointing to a single tenser, the \textit{orthogonality center}. Such networks have very useful properties, which we will explain in the following.
