In this chapter, we show that the YB-isoTPS ansatz introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:isoTPS_alternative_canonical_form} is able to exactly represent the ground state of the Toric Code Model, as was also shown for MM-isoTPS \cite{cite:isometric_tensor_network_representation_of_string_net_liquids}. We first give a brief introduction to the Toric Code model in Section \ref{sec:the_toric_code_model} and show how the ground state can be derived analytically. We then discuss how this ground state can be represented as a YB-isoTPS in Section \ref{sec:representing_the_toric_code_gs_with_YB_isoTPS}, following \cite{cite:isometric_tensor_network_representation_of_string_net_liquids}.
