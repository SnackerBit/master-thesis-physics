In this appendix we provide a brief introduction to Riemannian optimization, which can be used to optimize a cost function on the constrained set of isometric matrices. We optimize over the matrix manifold of isometric matrices, which is called the Stiefel manifold. For a more in-depth introduction to the topic we recommend the excellent book \cite{cite:optimization_on_matrix_manifolds}. Riemannian optimization of complex matrix manifolds is discussed in the context of quantum physics and isometric tensor networks in \cite{cite:riemannian_geometry_automatic_differentiation_quantum_physics, cite:riemannian_optimization_isometric_tensor_networks}. An implementation of Riemannian Optimization on the real Stiefel manifold and other matrix manifolds in python is given in \cite{cite:pymanopt}. Some parts of this implementation were also used in our implementation \cite{cite:github_YB_isoTPS}.
