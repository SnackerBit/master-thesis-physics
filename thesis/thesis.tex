	\section*{Abstract}
	The numerical simulation of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem. In the last decades, Tensor Networks have emerged as the standard method for tackling this problem in one dimensional systems in the form of Matrix Product States (MPS). Tensor Networks have also been generalized for the highly relevant problem of two and more spatial dimensions. However, these so-called Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are typically plagued by high computational complexity or drastic approximations. Recently, a new class of Tensor Networks, called isometric Tensor Networks, have been proposed for the simulation of two-dimensional quantum systems. This new class of Tensor Networks can be understood as a generalization of the one-dimensional Matrix Product States to higher dimensions. While isometric Tensor Networks generally capture only a subspace of the total Hilbert space, there are already promising results. In this work, we develop a new class of isometric Tensor Networks that has some key differences to the existing one. We show first numerical results for finding ground states of the Transverse Field Ising model.
