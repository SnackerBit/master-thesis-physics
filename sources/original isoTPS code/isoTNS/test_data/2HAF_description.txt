2leg HAF model with external staggered field:


	J( XX + YY + ZZ) + hN Z (-1)^{x + y}


	    J1
———————————————————————
        |       |
        |       | J2
        |       |
——————————————————————-


with 

	J1 = 1
	J2 = 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 

	hN = 0.05

hN was chosen so that at J2 = 0, the state was captured to eps = 1e-7 with 8*8 = 64 states
